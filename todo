in the s and T matrices, check if sigma is half integer or integer

in the off diagonal elements,
we have lambda' = lambda pm 1 but Sigma = sigma' mp 1

is this a misprint of the apostrohpes?
can investigate via the T+, T-



Tplus and T0 matrix need only to be computed once. can also do this for the VWS matrix for even faster computation
